partcl-nqp

Tcl 8.5 on the parrot VM. This does not use the tcl C library, but is a from-
scratch implementation using the Parrot Compiler Toolkit.

"nqp" in the name comes from the "nqp-rx" toolkit. NQP is Not Quite Perl 6,
and is a mini language that is much higher level than PIR. It also provides
a nice interface to writing mini languages, making it much easier to implement
the various mini languages inside tcl (globbing, regexen, binary)

See docs/todo.pod for a list of known issues.

See docs/overview.pod for information on how this version works.

See http://github.com/partcl/partcl for the original non-PCT version that
is more complete, but is only maintained to keep current with parrot changes.
