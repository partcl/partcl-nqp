partcl-nqp

Tcl 8.5 on the parrot VM. This does not use the tcl C library, but is a from-
scratch implementation using NQP.

NQP is "Not Quite Perl6", which started as a barebones implementation of perl6
on parrot, but has grown into a language target that is capable of targeting
multiple VMs, including Java, parrot, and Moar.

NQP provices a nice interface to writing mini languages, making it much easier
to implement the various mini languages inside tcl (globbing, regexen, binary).

See docs/todo.pod for a list of known issues.

See docs/overview.pod for information on how this version works.

See http://github.com/partcl/partcl for the original non-PCT version that
is more complete, but is only maintained to keep current with parrot changes.
