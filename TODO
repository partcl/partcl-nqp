Big Goal

* Be able to run any of partcl's test files to completion.
* Document how this version works.

Tasks:

* catch {} val
* regexp $re $str
* regsub -all <exp> <string> <replace>
* join <list> <joinString>
* split <string> <splitChars>
* [expr !<token>]
* backslash newline substitution can happen at any point, not just comments

Tests:
 until we can run test_more.tcl, this will keep us from regressing:

 This will run them with partcl-nqp
 
% prove t/sanity.t

 This will run the tests using tcl

% prove --exec tclsh8.5 t/sanity.t
