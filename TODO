Big Goals

* Document how this version works.

Tasks/Bugs:

* regexp $re $str
* regsub -all <exp> <string> <replace>
* [expr !<token>]
* support a bare minimum unknown - invoking a non-existant command should
  result in a tcl error, not a parrot error. (t/tcl_misc.t)
* list elements can be quoted words. (See puts [join {"a" b}]) - blocking
  t/tcl_backslash.t
* t/cmd_{for,while}.t both dying with "Lexical '$body' not found"
* [package] (at least as much as partcl has) (blocker for tcltest.tcl)

* support associative arrays
* error on references to non-existant variables
