Big Goal

* Be able to run any of partcl's test files to completion.
* Document how this version works.

Tasks:

* llength
* catch {} val
* regexp $re $str

Tests:
 until we can run test_more.tcl, this will keep us from regressing:

 This will run them with partcl-nqp
 
% prove t/sanity.t

 This will run the tests using tcl

% prove --exec tclsh8.5 t/sanity.t
