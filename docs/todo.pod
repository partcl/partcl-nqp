Document how to contribute to this version - ast, tcl, nqp ...

=head1 Tasks/Bugs:

=over 4

=item [unknown] {t/tcl_misc.t; t/tcl_catch.t}

Invoking a non-existant command should
result in a tcl error, not a parrot error.

=item [proc] {t/cmd_continue.t; t/cmd_break.t}

User-defined procs should catch continue/break and complain about them, as
should the :main PIR sub.

=item list processing

=item lists {t/tcl_conversion.t}

Single opening quotes are an invalid list element. {t/cmd_lappend.t}

=item support associative arrays

[array], $var(key), etc.

=item [proc] varargs support {t/cmd_proc.t; t/cmd_info.t}
need to handle special {args} parameter.
