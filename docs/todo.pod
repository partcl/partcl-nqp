=item [proc] {t/cmd_continue.t; t/cmd_break.t}

User-defined procs should catch continue/break and complain about them, as
should the :main PIR sub.

=item list processing

Single opening quotes are an invalid list element. {t/cmd_lappend.t}

=item [proc] varargs support {t/cmd_proc.t; t/cmd_info.t}
need to handle special {args} parameter.
